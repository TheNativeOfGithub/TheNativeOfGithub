Hello, I'm The Native Of Github a 
maniac kid who is intrested in programming 
and science mainly in physics and chemistry.
I want to fill my profile with some interesting
things like bots, AIs, operating systems, 
viruses and more. BUT I am not a good programmer
(I use A.I. for programming a lot of) and 
usually in my codes I have lot of bugs and 
issues. And that's why, if you find any 
problems in my codes, please share them 
with me!
(I'm not good in English, sorry!)
